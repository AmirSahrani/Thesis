# Thesis
This is the repo for my thesis. The jupyter notebook is where most of the data cleaning has been done. 
If any steps in data cleaning are unclear you'll probably find the anwsers there. All models are written in stan, 
to train the models you can use the `workspace.r` file to load the data and run the models. 

`Data_fix.py` was used to extract data from a saved terminal, since python crashed during data collection. 
`Devider.py` gave a random sequence for every tosser in order to give each auditor a random set of sequences.
`Visualize.py` was used to plot the data with a theoretical distribution for auditing purposes
`counter.py` was the script used by many tossers to record their data
